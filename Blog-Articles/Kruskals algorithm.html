	<h1>Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm</h1>

	<h5>By: Sruthi S</h5>

	<p>Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph that is a tree and connects all the vertices together. A single graph can have many different spanning trees. A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted, connected, undirected graph is a spanning tree with a weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree. The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of weights given to each edge of the spanning tree.</p>

	<ol>

		<li>Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.   </li>

		<li>Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far. If cycle is not formed, include this edge. Else, discard it.   </li>

		<li>Repeat step#2 until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree.</li>
