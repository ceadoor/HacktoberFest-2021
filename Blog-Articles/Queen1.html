	<h1>N Queen Problem</h1>
	<h5>By: Abhijith V</h5>
	<p>The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. For example, following is a solution for 4 Queen problem</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Start in the leftmost column</li>
		<li>If all queens are placed
    return true</li>
		<li>Try all rows in the current column. 
   Do following for every tried row.

        	<ol type="a">
            	<li>If the queen can be placed safely in this row 
       then mark this [row, column] as part of the 
       solution and recursively check if placing
       queen here leads to a solution.
 </li>
                <li>If placing the queen in [row, column] leads to
       a solution then return true. </li>
                <li>If placing queen doesn't lead to a solution then
       unmark this [row, column] (Backtrack) and go to 
       step (a) to try other rows. </li>

            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>If all rows have been tried and nothing worked,
   return false to trigger backtracking.</li>


	</ol>
